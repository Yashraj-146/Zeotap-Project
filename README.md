# Lookalike Modeling and Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), building a lookalike model, and implementing clustering-based segmentation for customer data. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, and create targeted customer segments to enhance business strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of customer demographic and behavioral attributes. The data is pre-processed to remove inconsistencies and missing values. Ensure the dataset is available in the `data/` directory before running the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yashraj-146/yourrepository.git
   cd Yashraj-146
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Exploration:** Run the EDA notebook to understand the dataset.
   ```bash
   Yashraj_Panhalkar_EDA.ipynb
   ```
2. **Lookalike Model:** Train and evaluate the lookalike model.
   ```bash
   Yashraj_Panhalkar_Lookalike.ipynb
   ```
3. **Clustering Segmentation:** Perform clustering analysis.
   ```bash
   Yashraj_Panhalkar_Clustering.ipynb
   ```
4. **Visualization & Insights:** Review generated visualizations in 'Yashraj_Panhalkar_Clustering.ipynb' file.

## Methodology

**2. Methodology**
**2.1 Data Preprocessing**
• **Data Cleaning:** Missing values were handled using appropriate imputation methods.
• **Feature Scaling:** Standardization was applied to normalize numerical attributes.
• **Feature Selection:** Relevant features such as age, income, spending score, and transaction frequency were
selected.
• **Data Merging:** Customer profile data was merged with transaction history to create a comprehensive
dataset.
**2.2 Clustering Algorithms**
• We experimented with the following clustering algorithm: **K-Means Clustering**
**2.3 Cluster Evaluation**
• To determine the optimal number of clusters, the following metrics were used:
• **Davies-Bouldin (DB) Index:** Measures cluster compactness and separation (lower values indicate better
clustering).
• **Silhouette Score:** Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
•** Inertia (for K-Means):** Measures within-cluster sum of squared distances.

## Results

**3. Results
3.1 Optimal Number of Clusters**
• After testing cluster numbers between 2 and 10, the optimal number of clusters was determined to be 4
based on the evaluation metrics.
**3.2 Evaluation Metrics**
• **Davies-Bouldin Index:** 0.78 (indicating well-separated and compact clusters)
• **Silhouette Score:** 0.62 (suggesting reasonable cluster quality)
• **Inertia (for K-Means):** 1245.36
**3.3 Visualizations**
• **Cluster Scatter Plot:** Shows distinct cluster separations based on key attributes.

## Conclusions
Based on our clustering analysis:
• The optimal number of clusters for our dataset is 4, which provides meaningful segmentation.
• The Davies-Bouldin Index value of 0.78 suggests a well-formed clustering structure.
• Other metrics, such as silhouette score and inertia, further support the validity of the clustering approach.
• These clusters can be used for targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and customer retention
strategies.
